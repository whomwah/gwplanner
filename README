BBC Gardeners' Planner as an .ics calendar
------------------------------------------

This app takes the data that is used to power:
http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/calendar/ 

and converts it into the .ics calendar format, so can subscribe to
it in your favourite calendaring tool like iCal or Google Calendar:

/planner.ics                         # full planner
/planner.ics?s=pond,trees,wildlife   # custom planner

Below are an example of the sections you can filter the calendar by.
This may change at any time, so it's best to use this list provided
by the app, when you go to /.

beddingplants
bulbs
celebritytips
climbingplants
containers
fruit
greenhouse
hedges
herbs
houseplants
lawn
perennials
pond
roses
shrubs
trees
vegetables
wildlife

This Sinatra app is currently setup to run under Passenger, you 
can find installation instructions at:

http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Apache.html#_sinatra

it require these gems:

- sinatra
- nokogiri
- icalendar
- rack/cache

I'm afraid the app comes as is, with no support.
